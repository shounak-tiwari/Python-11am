s2 = "Universal Informatics"
s3 = "Akash Tiwari"

BASIC INDEXING (Positive Index)

Print the first character of s1.
Print the third character of s2.
Print the character at index 5 of s3.

Print the last character of s1 using positive index.

Print the second last character of s2 using positive index.

NEGATIVE INDEXING

Print the last character of s3 using negative index.

Print the third character from the end of s1.

Print the first character of s2 using negative indexing.

Print the character at index -6 of s3.

Print the character just before the last one of s2.

INDEX LOGIC & UNDERSTANDING

Print the middle character of s1 using index.

Print the character whose index is len(s2) - 1.

Print the character at index len(s3)//2.

Print the character at index len(s1)//3.

Print the character at index -(len(s2)//2).

TRICKY / CONCEPTUAL INDEXING

Predict the output:
print(s1[0], s1[-1])

Predict the output:
print(s2[len(s2) - 3])

Predict the output:
print(s3[-len(s3)])

Predict the output:
print(s1[len(s1)//2 - 1])

Is this valid? If yes, what is the output?
print(s3[-1 + 1])
