text = "Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) was a revolutionary freedom fighter and a prominent figure in India’s struggle for independence. Born in Banga (now in Pakistan), he was influenced by his family’s involvement in the independence movement and events like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Initially drawn to Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement, Bhagat Singh later became disillusioned with non-violence and embraced revolutionary ideals. He joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and became a strong advocate for socialism and secularism. Bhagat Singh’s most notable actions include avenging the death of Lala Lajpat Rai by assassinating British officer John Saunders in 1928 and throwing non-lethal bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929 to protest colonial policies. Arrested and tried for his revolutionary activities, he used the courtroom as a platform to spread his vision for an independent and egalitarian India. Despite widespread support, he was executed by the British on March 23, 1931, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, making him a martyr and a symbol of selfless sacrifice for the nation. His life continues to inspire generations to fight for justice and equality."
