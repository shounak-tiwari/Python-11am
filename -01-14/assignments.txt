Here are **5 Python inheritance exercise questions**, arranged from basic to slightly more advanced. These are **questions only** (no solutions yet), suitable for practice or exams.

### **Inheritance Exercise – Python**

#### **Question 1: Single Inheritance**

Create a class `Animal` with a method `sound()` that prints `"Animal makes a sound"`.
Create a subclass `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `sound()` method to print `"Dog barks"`.
Create an object of `Dog` and call the `sound()` method.

---

#### **Question 2: Using `super()`**

Create a class `Person` with:

* an `__init__` method that accepts `name` and `age`.

Create a subclass `Student` that:

* adds an attribute `student_id`,
* uses `super()` to call the parent constructor.

Create an object of `Student` and print all its attributes.

---

#### **Question 3: Multilevel Inheritance**

Create:

* a class `Vehicle` with a method `start()`,
* a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle`,
* a subclass `ElectricCar` that inherits from `Car` and has a method `charge()`.

Create an object of `ElectricCar` and call both `start()` and `charge()` methods.

---

#### **Question 4: Method Overriding**

Create a class `Employee` with a method `calculate_salary()` that returns a fixed salary of `30000`.
Create a subclass `Manager` that overrides `calculate_salary()` to return `50000`.
Create objects of both classes and print their salaries.

---

#### **Question 5: Hierarchical Inheritance**

Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()` that prints `"Area not defined"`.
Create two subclasses:

* `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`,
* `Circle` with attribute `radius`.

Each subclass should override the `area()` method to calculate and print its area.
